# About Barcelona

Here are my recommendations for a trip to Barcelona. I wasn't born there but I've lived for about 20 years in the city and I get to visit every year. I still miss it for many reasons and if you go visit, you will know why! :)

Actually Barcelona tourist books are pretty good at recommending places to go. Nevertheless, here are some from my own.

> **Disclaimer on politics  and current situation in BCN / Spain**. Catalunya (Catalonia) is currently a region of Spain, not quite a state like in the US, but it has been a stateless nation for many centuries. After losing its Independence in 1714, it has maintained its culture and language. The language spoken in Catalunya is Català (Catalan language). Catalan is not a dialect of Spanish, but a whole different language, with its own grammar and different spelling. As all languages that come from Latin, there are similitudes to Spanish, Italian, Portuguese and French. The citizens of Catalunya speak both Catalan and Spanish. We are bilingual. Nowadays, the state of Catalunya is on a move to become an independent state, as we were 300 years ago. The whole fight between Spain and Catalunya is strong and our cultures clash often. Don't be surprised if you see yellow ribbons along the city. These have nothing to do with the military as in US, these have to do with our current political leaders, who have been imprisoned without a trial for 2 years, and our claim for them and our country to be free.

## TL;DR;

- First and main advice: **Do not eat any paella at The Ramblas**. It's just 'tourist traps'.
- A great place in Barcelona to eat paella or other rice cooking styles (I recommend 'arròs caldós' which translates roughly to 'soupy rice') is at [Refugi del Port](https://goo.gl/maps/ecKKnHG6cgq) restaurant. Awesome rice there!
- You'll be at Barceloneta neighborhood. While you're there, if you like a superb old-fashioned, wood-oven baked bread, go to [Baluard Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/qoeL57M9cZ32).
- If you rather fancy some wine, cheese and serrano ham tasting, visit [Vila Viniteca](https://goo.gl/maps/fAZVSVZcEdu). You'll want to come back!
- Visit the [Gothic neighborhood](https://goo.gl/maps/ymH3SwDMP3D2). This is Barcelona original city from Roman times, when it was called Barcino. Just lose yourself in the streets and enjoy the architecture, narrow alleys and great bars and restaurants you'll find here and there.
- While you're there, if you want a fantastic sandwich (Europan-like sandwich, not American-like) go to [Conesa Sandwich Bar](https://goo.gl/maps/t5SuRBEkLLM2) at Sant Jaume Square. In that square are l'Ajuntament de Barcelona (Barcelona's City Hall) at the West and The Generalitat de Catalunya (Catalonia's Government) at the East. Some parts of both buildings date back to the 12th century. Actually, Catalonia has the oldest Parliament in the world and it started at the current Generalitat building.
- If you can only go to one place, be it el [Mercat de la Boqueria](https://goo.gl/maps/TtmsswS9ruj) (Boqueria's Market). It's an ancient market which has been in business since the 13th century! You'll find lots of different and exotic products there. Try any of the on-site bars there for a snack and lose yourself between products, colors and scents!

These are _pocket friendly_, yet really good, suggestions. If you're looking for something more specific, I can point you to some other restaurants!
 
Now, some streetwise words. Barcelona is a big city that has a lot of tourism. With lots of tourism, come lots of pickpockets! So, some advice:
- **If you carry a bag, get it close at all times and in front of you, even if it's a backpack!**
- Be specially vigilant of your belongings when you're walking by the Ramblas or when using the metro (underground).
- Try to avoid the [Raval neighborhood](https://goo.gl/maps/TJTZpMzYWD12). Not that is dangerous, but there are some serious drug-dealing issues going on in this neighborhood, try to avoid it.
- As a general advice, be always aware of your surroundings.

Enjoy your trip to Barcelona!

## Hotels / Transportation

Regarding hotels, look at 3 stars or better; top North part of the Ramblas or North from the Plaça de Catalunya. Look at both Rambla Catalunya or Passeig de Gràcia. There are many new Small Boutique hotels in the Gothic quarter, just stick to 3 \* or better. Many offer breakfasts.

There are lots of “Home Away”, “VRBO” and “AirBnB” etc. Make sure you rent via an official website and they have an approved license number. The City Hall has put a limit on the amount of apartments that can be licensed for nightly use. There are many illegal rentals.

From the airport to Barcelona, there is train service and a bus. Don’t rent a car unless you want to go out of Barcelona.

## Culture / Art / Architecture

Barcelona is full of history, architecture, art, music, etc. So plan a few days there. I highly recommend to use the city tourist bus, managed by the City Hall. It allows you to hop on and off, for one daily price. There are two or three routes, each going to several spots. You can get the ticket as you board. 

https://www.barcelonabusturistic.cat/en

Taking the Gaudí route is an amazing journey ([La Pedrera](https://goo.gl/maps/55aoMJKN4ky381JY7), aka Casa Milà, [Park Güell](https://goo.gl/maps/NPaFotVGtGXHRsEs5) and [La Sagrada Família](https://goo.gl/maps/bQVs9Kw8zjL3wsu98)). Near to La Pedrera is [La Casa Batlló](https://goo.gl/maps/SdB7S8zf3qqvYQQ39), another beautiful site.

Then there is a day or two of museums - [Museu d’Art Modern](https://goo.gl/maps/ikSP3zWFHahSvhaH6), [Museu d’Història de Catalunya](https://goo.gl/maps/cS2pAM5F6cXaCKYy8), [Museu Picasso](https://g.page/museupicassobarcelona?share), [Fundació Miró](https://goo.gl/maps/eN3UKpfg1BJjdENh7), etc.

For architecture and music lovers there is el [Palau de la Música Catalana](https://goo.gl/maps/r1esyEwmQcuE4rX9A) (the Music Palace) and [El Liceu](https://goo.gl/maps/YZ3KvM7oiUc6h7Wa8) (the opera house).

And the Gothic [Cathedral](https://goo.gl/maps/YsRJpbYLwPuLbbnS8) (it has an elevator to go to the top roof), the [Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar](https://goo.gl/maps/aL5o4doH3o1ZpYwL9) (Santa Maria’s Church), the [City Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/htSC6TJ1qgq42RRi7), the [Generalitat de Catalunya](https://goo.gl/maps/QsEgmYMwP6PwYdao8) and the beachfront. The [Montjuïc Castle](https://goo.gl/maps/3Qc29tRHYMHDwwfu8) has nice views, and you can't miss the [Magic Fountains of Montjuïc](https://goo.gl/maps/NmM2LVgYtGj76tBE9) (just below the Olympic area) with a nightly show of dancing water and light show with music.

## Outside of Barcelona

Just 30 minutes South of Barcelona is the town of Sitges, it is great for a day trip to get away, with beautiful beaches, amazing food and lovely water front. You can go via the regional train or car.

To the North of Barcelona, about 1.5hr drive is the area of the Costa Brava. It includes the small Catalan region of Baix and Alt Empordà, one of the most amazing coast lines in Catalunya. Similar to the Amalfi coast or the area of Toscana in Italy. The area of Baix Empordà has plenty of historical little towns that have been rebuilt maintaining its old looks. There are prehistoric little towns, archeological spots, etc. In Empúria Brava (a little further north) is the Greek and Roman ruins, one amazing thing to see. There are several little towns close to Calella de Palafrugell to do several day trips. Then there is the town of Cadaquès, the summer spot of Dalí. The town of Figures has his museum with some wacky things/art he did.

Some towns to look for housing are; Calella de Palafrugell, Llafranch, Tamariu, Begur, Pals, Torroella de Montgrí,i Palamós. 

See this website, in Spanish but has great information - http://www.sempreviaggiando.com/2015/08/25/pueblos-con-encanto-emporda/

Then there is the city of Girona (many spots from the 6th season of Game of Thrones were filmed there).

The Pyrenees are amazing mountains making a natural division between Spain and France, places worth seeing are Olot, Banyoles, Camprodon and Set Cases…

Google all of it, it will show you the distance in maps. For example, Calella is 1.5hr from Barcelona. From Calella is about 2 to 3hr drive to Camprodon (Pyrenees).

## Food & Wine!

Many restaurants in Spain have a lunch Menu, it is a fix price and you get to choose your 1st and 2nd course out of a selection; most including dessert. This can be very simple or more fancy depending on restaurant. An average will be between 15 to 30 euros.

If you enjoy wines, Rioja and Ribera del Duero are two regions in Spain with amazing wines and not too expensive. My Catalan favorites are Costers del Segre, Priorat and Monstant. A note to remember is that Crianza (_Criança_ in Catalan) is a younger wine than a Reserva. It will also be cheaper.

Aside from the restaurants suggested in the **TL;DR;** section, here are more (fairly priced):

- [Restaurant 4 Gats](https://goo.gl/maps/MbSD45bHU4BYcv8A9) - here is where Picasso and his friends used to go. Make reservations for dinner at http://4gats.com/en/. Also good for lunch (very close to center Plaça de Catalunya and the Cathedral). Carrer de Montsió, 3, 08002 Barcelona.
- [Abasolo Etxea](https://goo.gl/maps/qpGdLHaL9VvAFH1q6) - Typical Basc tapas and full sit-down restaurant. I love this place. Also very close to the Ramblas. Carrer de Marià Cubí, 190, 08021 Barcelona.   
- [Bar Mut](https://goo.gl/maps/5ERaMcoF9LyZMvUL8). Their website is quite original, via videos as a movie they show the place and the tapas. You will need a reservation, do it at http://www.barmut.com. Carrer de Pau Claris, 192, 08037 Barcelona.
- [Cerveseria Catalana](https://goo.gl/maps/ev3nBzmNgmX68Cjm6). Great for a night out with friends or family too. Carrer de Mallorca, 236, 08008 Barcelona
- [Antunez](https://g.page/antunezbcn?share) - Amazing small plates with great taste. Think tapas to share. Carrer de Neptú, 18, 08006 Barcelona.
- [Cal Tomas](https://goo.gl/maps/tz75vF2vdiewMd1S9) - The BEST Patates Braves in Barcelona. Major de Sarrià, 49, 08017 Barcelona. http://www.eltomasdesarria.com/


Now, on the high end price:

- [Les 7 Portes](https://goo.gl/maps/fyXcCnCEAt3HQquw5), Catalan cuisine specialty.
